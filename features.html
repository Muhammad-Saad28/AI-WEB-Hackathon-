                <h3>Inventory Management</h3>
                <p>Track and manage your kitchen inventory in real-time. Keep an eye on your pantry, fridge, and freezer, making sure you never run out of essential ingredients for your meals. The system allows you to input and categorize items, update quantities, and track expiry dates.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Imagine you want to cook a pasta dish, but you're unsure if you have enough tomatoes or garlic. With our system, you can quickly check your inventory, saving you the time and effort of opening every cupboard or going to the store unnecessarily.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature section-box">
                <h3>Recipe Suggestions</h3>
                <p>Get personalized recipe suggestions based on the ingredients you already have. No more scrambling for meal ideas at the last minute! Our app suggests creative recipes, making it easier for you to whip up a meal without needing to run out for extra groceries.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Have chicken, onions, and spinach in your fridge, but unsure what to make? The system will suggest recipes like chicken stir-fry or a spinach salad, minimizing food waste and making the most out of your existing stock.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature section-box">
                <h3>Waste Reduction</h3>
                <p>Minimize food waste by tracking expiration dates and suggesting ways to use leftover ingredients efficiently. The system will alert you when items are nearing their expiration date and give you ideas on how to use them before they go bad.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> You bought a bunch of fresh herbs that you didn't finish using last week. The system notifies you that they are about to expire and suggests a recipe or method to use them up—like making a pesto sauce or adding them to a soup—so nothing goes to waste!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature section-box">
                <h3>Smart Grocery Shopping</h3>
                <p>Our system creates efficient shopping lists based on your current inventory, recipe preferences, and meal plans. It removes duplicate items from your shopping list, making your trips to the grocery store quicker and more organized.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> If you're planning a week's worth of meals, our system generates a shopping list with only the ingredients you need, ensuring you don't buy unnecessary items. It even removes the items you already have in your pantry, preventing you from doubling up on purchases.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature section-box">
                <h3>Meal Planning</h3>
                <p>Organize your meals in advance with a simple-to-use meal planner. The system allows you to schedule meals for the week, check if you have the required ingredients, and avoid last-minute meal decisions. Meal planning helps reduce stress during busy workweeks and promotes healthier eating.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> On Sunday night, plan your meals for the week. You can add your favorite dishes and let the app check your pantry. If you're missing anything, it will create a shopping list for you. This feature takes the guesswork out of daily meal preparation!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature section-box">
                <h3>Personalized Notifications</h3>
                <p>Receive personalized notifications when items in your kitchen are running low or about to expire. Stay updated about stock changes or recipe suggestions that fit your dietary preferences. These notifications make sure you're always prepared for your next meal or grocery trip.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Get notified that your milk is about to expire in a few days. You can then use it in a recipe suggestion (like a smoothie or a baked good) before it spoils, or adjust your grocery list to buy a fresh carton during your next shopping trip.</p>
